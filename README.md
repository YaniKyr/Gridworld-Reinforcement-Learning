# Gridworld-Reinforcement-Learning
A simple Reinforcement Learning project. The RL algorithm solves the Gridworld that the code generates. The Gridworld and Path results are displayed in the matplotlib pop-up window.

# Examples

## Example 1 10X10 Gridworld and the solution.

### The calculated values in the matrix, are represented below:

## Example 2 10X10 Gridworld and the solution. 
![Fig1](https://github.com/YaniKyr/Gridworld-Reinforcement-Learning/mockups/figure2.png)
### The calculated values in the matrix, are represented below:

The code, does not always solve the Gworld. The higher the length and the number of lavas, the higher the fail rate
