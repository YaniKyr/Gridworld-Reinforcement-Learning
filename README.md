# Gridworld-Reinforcement-Learning
A simple Reinforcement Learning project. The RL algorithm solves the Gridworld that the code generates. The Gridworld and Path results are displayed in the matplotlib pop-up window.

# Examples

## Example 1 10X10 Gridworld and the solution.

### The calculated values in the matrix, are represented below:

## Example 2 10X10 Gridworld and the solution.

The code, does not always solve the Gworld. The higher the length and the number of lavas, the higher the fail rate
